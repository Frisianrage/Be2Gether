## Be2Gether

Be2Gether is a social media webapplication for people in a LDR (long distance relationship). I build this app as my final project in the WBS Coding school fullstack web and app bootcamp.

The stack i used:
- react (frontend)
- firebase (backend)

The CSS is custom made, that's also the reason why it's not very pretty, yet! ;-)

This project is still work in progress!

Check the code and give me feedback if you like. 

You can test my app here: https://projectone-ac97c.web.app/ 


### Usage

For full usage you need (of course) a partner.

Main components so far are a chat, a map and a travelblog.

The chat is obviously a chat where you can text with your loved one and also exchange pictures. 
The map is a worldmap in which you can mark places you've been together. Add places, pictures and stories. 
You can access these pictures and stories through the map or the travelblog. 
The travelblog is right now still under construction but the first stones are set.

### Future

I hope i build more into this project because it's really my baby. I also have some more plans, but as usual it's challenging to find the right time for it.
So if you like my project or have any sort of feedback feel free to reach out to me!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
